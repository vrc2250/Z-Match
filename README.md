Greetings. This is version 1 of Z-Match.. An application I built to help make the files generated on Zaxcom Transmitters 
easier to used by Post Production.
It does this by comparing the timecode between your Master Recorder and Transmitter.. 
When matches are found you can then tell the application to Commit to Copying matching transmitters files to a new Folder (Named the Recorders 
roll number) and renames them to match the recorders Scene/Take and Selected Track Name. 
An example might be original transmitter name 06282400_152900_Boom1_485.wav, copies and renames it 109H-T1-MKH416.WAV.
Much more readable for Post Production.. It also creates a simple sound report included in the folder..
Hope this helps some mixers
